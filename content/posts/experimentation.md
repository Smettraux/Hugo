As part of my tech research, I stumbled upon [Free Frontend](https://freefrontend.com). A curated collection of free hand-picked HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery, React, Vue) code examples, tutorials and articles.

## Subject & Objectives
I recently developed a small one pager, with a simple HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JS combination. As I presented it, I was suggested some UI modifications, that I still have to implement at this very moment.

So this is the perfect occasion: try to fit what I find on free frontend on [this project](https://botte-cordiale.surge.sh).

The goal is to make the website look like the one on the cover picture, while trying to find useful features on Free Frontend.

For reference, the website looks like this for the time being:

## Expected results

## Conclusion
 What I learned from this experiment:
 Reusing the methodology somewhere.
