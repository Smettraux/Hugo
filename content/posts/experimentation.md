As part of my tech research, I stumbled upon [Free Frontend](https://freefrontend.com). A curated collection of free hand-picked HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery, React, Vue) code examples, tutorials and articles.

## Subject & Objectives
I recently developed a small one pager, with a simple HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JS combination. As I presented it, I was suggested some UI modifications, that I still have to implement at this very moment.

So this is the perfect occasion: try to fit what I find on free frontend on [this project](https://botte-cordiale.surge.sh).

The goal is to make the website look like the one on the cover picture, while trying to find useful features on Free Frontend.

For reference, the website looks like this for the time being:
![botte-cordiale](https://github.com/Smettraux/Hugo/blob/master/static/images/botte-cordiale-v1-front.png?raw=true)

## Expected results
I think I'll find most of what I need for the animations and the "About" card that has to be implemented.
I'll probably have to clean up the code to take only the bits and pieces useful for my project, as it's never short, clean snippets as you could find on [code drops](https://codedrops.io/).

## What I did
I started by adjusting the layout and CSS to what I was asked, and it became something pretty similar.
![botte-cordiale-v1.5](https://github.com/Smettraux/Hugo/blob/master/static/images/botte-cordiale_v2_a.png?raw=true)


I now have to add some animations to the buttons and a card that pops up when I click on the "About"(A propos) button.

I should look like something like this:
![botte-cordiale-v2-about](https://github.com/Smettraux/Hugo/blob/master/static/images/botte-cordiale-v2-about.png?raw=true)

As I said, I'm going to try and find some useful features on Free Frontend. On the homepage, the website presents a list of links to the latest articles and tutorials, as well as a menu of different technologies.

![FreeFrontend Menu](https://github.com/Smettraux/Hugo/blob/master/static/images/freefrontend-home.png?raw=true)

I chose the CSS link, and scrolls to the "Essentials" section. I then looked through different lists of 'cards' elements and found one somewhat similar to what I was looking for.

## Actual results

## Conclusion
 What I learned from this experiment:
 Reusing the methodology somewhere.
