I'm **Steve Mettraux**. I'm a media engineer from Switzerland. I studied web development, digital marketing strategy, brand developpment and UI/UX design at the HEIG-VD, in Yverdon-les-Bains.

Everyday, I work on finding inspiration for my project driven life. I'm always looking for new challenges and new ways to improve myself.
I usually find inspiration while allowing myself to get lost, would it be in the nature or on the web.
