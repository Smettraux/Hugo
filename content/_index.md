I began my engineering carrer back in 2015, in EPFL as a microtecnic student. After 2 years of study, I decided to change plans and move back in Yverdon-les-Bains, to try microtecnics in a diferent, more practical way.
After I began my studies in HEIG-VD, I discovered media engineering, and fell in love with it.

That was to exemplify my passion for engineering, and the foolishness of my career. I am now a Media Engineering student, specializing in frontend Javascript & UX/Design. I'm passionate about making the world better one line of code at a time with accessible, intuitive design.
